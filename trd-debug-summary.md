# TRD Multi-Item Interface Debug Summary

## Problem
The TRD multi-item interface was not showing when opening TRD cards in the Development Bank modal.

## Root Cause
The `useDevelopmentCards` hook was missing the `'trd'` card type in its `DEVELOPMENT_CARD_TYPES` array. This caused TRD cards with `card_type: 'trd'` to not be fetched from the database.

## Database Analysis
The TRD system supports three card types:
- `'trd'` - Basic TRD cards
- `'technical-requirement'` - Legacy technical requirement cards  
- `'technical-requirement-structured'` - Structured technical requirement cards

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `useDevelopmentCards.ts`
- Added `'trd'` to the `DEVELOPMENT_CARD_TYPES` array
- Updated section mappings to include `'trd'` cards in technical requirements sections
- Updated section count calculations to include TRD cards
- Updated `technicalRequirements` helper to return all TRD-related card types

### 2. DevelopmentCardModal Debug
- Added temporary debug logging to identify card types being passed
- Confirmed that the modal routing logic correctly handles `'trd'` cards
- Verified that `TRDCardMultiItem` component is properly imported and configured

## Testing
Created test scripts:
- `debug-trd-cards.js` - Query and analyze existing TRD cards
- `create-test-trd.js` - Create a test TRD card for verification

## Expected Behavior
After these changes:
1. TRD cards with `card_type: 'trd'` should now appear in the Development Bank
2. Clicking on a TRD card should open the modal with the TRD multi-item interface
3. The interface should display all TRD-specific sections (API Endpoints, Security Controls, etc.)

## Files Modified
- `/src/hooks/useDevelopmentCards.ts` - Added TRD card type support
- `/src/components/development-cards/DevelopmentCardModal.tsx` - Temporarily added debug logging (removed)

## Next Steps
1. Test the interface with existing TRD cards
2. If no TRD cards exist, create test cards using the provided script
3. Verify that all TRD multi-item sections are working correctly
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors
