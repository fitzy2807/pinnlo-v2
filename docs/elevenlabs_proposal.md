## 🚀 **Feature 1: Voice Intelligence Capture**

### **Description**
Transform spoken content (meetings, interviews, research notes) into structured intelligence cards through natural voice input.

### **How It Works**
1. User clicks "Voice Intelligence" button in Intelligence Bank
2. ElevenLabs agent begins listening and provides real-time feedback
3. User speaks research findings, meeting notes, or competitor insights
4. Agent processes speech through PINNLO MCP server
5. Structured intelligence cards auto-generated and appear in Intelligence Bank
6. User can refine through continued voice interaction

### **User Flow**
```
User: "I just spoke with three enterprise customers about their biggest pain points..."
Agent: "I'm capturing this customer intelligence. What category should I file this under?"
User: "Customer research"
Agent: "Perfect. I've created 4 customer insight cards. Would you like me to analyze patterns across your existing customer intelligence?"
```
