## 3. Test Scenarios

### 3.1 Card Lifecycle Test
```
1. Open Intelligence Bank
2. Navigate to "Market" category
3. Click "Create Card"
4. Fill in all fields:
   - Title: "Test Market Intelligence"
   - Summary: "Test summary"
   - Content: "Detailed intelligence content"
   - Add key findings
   - Set scores (credibility: 8, relevance: 9)
   - Add tags
5. Save card
6. Verify card appears in Market category
7. Expand card to view all details
8. Click "Save" to move to saved section
9. Navigate to "Saved Cards" - verify card is there
10. Click "Archive" 
11. Navigate to "Archive" - verify card is there
12. Click "Restore to Active"
13. Navigate back to Market - verify card is restored
14. Delete card permanently
```

### 3.2 Search and Filter Test
```
1. Create multiple test cards across categories
2. Use search bar to find cards by keyword
3. Apply credibility score filter (>= 7)
4. Apply relevance score filter (>= 8)
5. Sort by date/relevance/credibility
6. Toggle between grid and list views
7. Clear all filters
```

### 3.3 Category Management Test
```
1. Create cards in different categories:
   - Market: 3 cards
   - Competitor: 2 cards
   - Technology: 4 cards
2. Verify sidebar counts update correctly
3. Save 2 cards - verify "Saved Cards" count
4. Archive 1 card - verify "Archive" count
5. Verify total card count in header
```

### 3.4 Editor Validation Test
```
1. Try to save card without required fields
2. Verify validation errors appear
3. Test score validation (must be 1-10)
4. Test array field inputs (tags, key findings)
5. Test date picker functionality
6. Test URL field with source reference
```

## 4. Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance:
- Card load time: < 500ms
- Search response: < 200ms
- Create/Update: < 1 second
- Count updates: Real-time

### Database Indexes:
- user_id (B-tree)
- category (B-tree)
- status (B-tree)
- created_at DESC (B-tree)
- tags (GIN)
- key_findings (GIN)

## 5. Known Limitations

### Current System:
1. No pagination (loads up to 50 cards)
2. No bulk operations
3. No export functionality
4. No version history
5. Basic search (no advanced operators)

### Future Enhancements:
1. Pagination for large datasets
2. Bulk select and operations
3. Export to PDF/CSV
4. Card templates
5. Advanced search with filters
6. Collaboration features
7. AI-powered card generation

## 6. Security Validation

### RLS Policies Tested:
- Users can only see their own cards ✓
- Users can only create cards for themselves ✓
- Users can only update their own cards ✓
- Users can only delete their own cards ✓

### Input Validation:
- Required fields enforced ✓
- Score ranges validated (1-10) ✓
- XSS prevention on all text inputs ✓
- SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries ✓

## 7. Integration Points

### Ready for MCP Agents:
The system is now ready to accept intelligence cards from:
1. **External MCP** - API endpoint ready
2. **Stakeholder Input** - Manual creation working
3. **Link Parser** - Can store parsed content
4. **Document Upload** - Can store extracted intelligence
5. **Manual Entry** - Full editor available

### API Endpoints:
- Create: `POST /api/intelligence-cards`
- Read: `GET /api/intelligence-cards`
- Update: `PUT /api/intelligence-cards/:id`
- Delete: `DELETE /api/intelligence-cards/:id`

## 8. Test Data

### Sample Cards Provided:
- 8 realistic intelligence cards
- One for each category
- Various scores and completeness
- Different content types
- Realistic tags and metadata

### Test File Location:
`/tests/intelligence-cards-test-data.json`

## 9. Validation Results
