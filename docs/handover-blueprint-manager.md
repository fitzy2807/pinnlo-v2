// Get blueprint data for display
const config = getBlueprintConfig(blueprintId)
const icon = config?.icon || '📄'
const name = config?.name || blueprintId
```

### **Database Operations**
```typescript
// Save blueprint configuration to strategies table
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('strategies')
  .update({
    blueprint_config: {
      enabledBlueprints: selectedBlueprints,
      mandatoryBlueprints: MANDATORY_BLUEPRINTS,
      lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()

## 🚨 **Common Procedures**

### **Adding a New Blueprint Type**
1. Create blueprint config file in `/src/components/blueprints/configs/`
2. Add import and entry to `/src/components/blueprints/registry.ts`
3. Add to appropriate category in `BLUEPRINT_CATEGORIES`
4. Add to `STRATEGY_HUB_BLUEPRINTS` if it should appear in Strategy Hub
5. Test component renders new blueprint correctly

### **Updating Blueprint Configuration**
1. Modify the blueprint config file
2. Update registry if ID or structure changes
3. Test existing strategies still work correctly
4. Consider database migration if breaking changes

### **Debugging Selection Issues**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify blueprint exists in registry: `getBlueprintConfig(blueprintId)`
3. Check database for correct strategy ID and permissions
4. Verify Supabase connection and RLS policies

### **Performance Optimization**
1. Monitor component render time with React DevTools
2. Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
3. Optimize blueprint registry loading
4. Consider virtual scrolling for large blueprint lists

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Component Not Loading**

**Solutions**:
1. Check `STRATEGY_HUB_BLUEPRINTS` array
2. Verify blueprint configs exist in registry
3. Clear search and filter settings
4. Check browser console for errors

### **Selections Not Saving**
**Symptoms**: Selected blueprints reset after save
**Causes**:

- Network connectivity problems
- Invalid strategy ID
**Solutions**:
1. Check Supabase RLS policies
2. Verify user authentication
3. Test network connection
4. Check strategy ID validity

### **Performance Issues**
**Symptoms**: Slow loading or laggy interactions
**Causes**:
- Too many blueprints loaded
- Inefficient rendering
- Network latency
**Solutions**:
1. Implement virtual scrolling

## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Q: How do I add a new blueprint type?**
A: Create a blueprint config file, add it to the registry, and include it in the appropriate categories. See "Adding a New Blueprint Type" procedure above.

### **Q: Why can't users deselect required blueprints?**
A: Required blueprints (defined in `REQUIRED_BLUEPRINTS`) are essential for basic strategy functionality. The UI prevents deselection with disabled state and visual indicators.

### **Q: How are blueprint icons determined?**
A: Icons are defined in individual blueprint config files via the `icon` property. If no icon is specified, a default document emoji (📄) is used.

### **Q: Can users reorder blueprints?**
A: Currently no. Blueprints are displayed in the order defined by `STRATEGY_HUB_BLUEPRINTS`. Drag-and-drop reordering could be added as a future enhancement.

### **Q: How does search and filtering work?**
A: Search filters by blueprint name and description. Category filter uses the blueprint's category property. Both filters work together (AND logic).

### **Q: What happens to cards when a blueprint is deselected?**
A: The blueprint manager only controls which blueprint types are available for new card creation. Existing cards are not affected by blueprint selection changes.

### **Q: How are blueprint configurations backed up?**
A: Blueprint configurations are stored in the `strategies.blueprint_config` JSONB column and backed up as part of the main database backup procedures.

### **Q: Can multiple users collaborate on blueprint selection?**
A: Currently no. Blueprint configurations are per-strategy and per-user. Real-time collaboration would require additional development.
