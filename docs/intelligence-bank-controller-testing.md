## 7. Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Source Type Filtering**: Backend doesn't store source type, so this filter has no effect
2. **Status Filtering**: May conflict with saved/archived category views
3. **Bulk Operations**: Currently placeholder implementations, need API integration
4. **Export Format**: Exports only card IDs, not full card data
5. **Mobile Sort**: Dropdown may be cut off on very small screens
6. **Filter Persistence**: Filters reset on page reload

## 8. Recommendations

1. Implement actual bulk operations in the API
2. Add source_type field to intelligence_cards table
3. Improve mobile sort dropdown positioning
4. Add filter persistence to localStorage
5. Enhance export to include full card data
6. Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
7. Consider pagination for large result sets
