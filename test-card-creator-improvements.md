# Card Creator Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Dynamic Field Parsing
- Added `getBlueprintFields` function to Card Creator MCP tool
- Reads actual TypeScript blueprint config files
- Extracts exact field names, types, requirements, and descriptions
- Provides explicit field specifications to AI

### 2. Single Card Generation
- Modified to generate ONE card at a time instead of batch
- Loop through planned quantity with progress updates
- Better error handling per card
- More consistent results

### 3. Restored Card Selection Step
- Users can now select specific cards as context (not all cards automatically)
- Flow is now: Source Selection → Card Selection → Output Config → Preview → Generate

### 4. Enhanced Navigation
- After card creation, automatically navigates to the target section
- No more page reload - smooth transition to view new cards
- Passes metadata about target section through the creation flow

### 5. Improved Prompts
- Single card prompts include exact field specifications
- Example format for each field type (string, array, etc.)
- Clear instructions about required vs optional fields
- Blueprint-specific field names instead of generic

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Field Population**:
   - Create a value proposition card
   - Check that all fields are populated:
     - customerSegment
     - problemSolved
     - gainCreated
     - alternativeSolutions (array)
     - differentiator

2. **Test Single Card Generation**:
   - In preview, approve creation of 3 cards
   - Should see progress: "Generating card 1 of 3..."
   - Each card generated individually

3. **Test Navigation**:
   - After creation, should navigate to the section
   - No page reload
   - New cards visible immediately

4. **Test Different Blueprint Types**:
   - Try creating Vision cards
   - Try creating Feature cards
   - Each should have appropriate fields

## Expected Behavior

### Preview Response Format:
```
Based on [analysis], I will create **four** value proposition cards:

1. **Card Title 1**: Brief description
   - Customer Segment: Specific segment
   - Problem Solved: Key problem addressed
   
2. **Card Title 2**: Brief description
   - Customer Segment: Different segment
   - Problem Solved: Different problem

[etc...]
```

### Generated Card Format:
```json
{
  "title": "Clear, Actionable Title",
  "description": "2-3 sentence description",
  "priority": "high",
  "blueprintFields": {
    "customerSegment": "Small business owners in retail",
    "problemSolved": "Difficulty tracking customer feedback across channels",
    "gainCreated": "Unified view of all customer interactions",
    "alternativeSolutions": ["Manual spreadsheets", "Multiple disconnected tools"],
    "differentiator": "AI-powered sentiment analysis and automated categorization"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **If fields are empty**: Check that blueprint config files exist in `/src/components/blueprints/configs/`
2. **If only 1 card generates**: Verify the preview extracted the correct quantity
3. **If navigation fails**: Check that targetSection metadata is being passed through
